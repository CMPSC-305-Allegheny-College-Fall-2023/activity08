## Assigned: 25 October 2023

## Due: END OF CLASS

![bases](./graphics/automation.png)

Not all users of an SQL database need to know how to actually program a in SQL. Programming languages such as Python have libraries which can be used to create a program to manage the database for a user.

## Project Goals

* To use Python and the `sqlite3` library to build a basic database manager
* To determine the steps in code which are necessary for building the  management system.
* To determine how to use Python programming to alter a previously created database system.

## Instructions

Please address the TODO's in the `python` code provided with this activity: `src/makeQuery.py` and `scr/makeEdit.py`. You are to submit this work to your GitHub repository at least three (3) times. Please enter all code from class as your deliverable. Your instructor will have more information about this activity. Note: some of your code may require a database. In this case, please feel free to use the included builder file for the CampusDB

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade. Your work will be considered complete when you see the green check-mark at the top of page of your GitHub repository.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

  + [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Do not forget to use git commands to push your work to the cloud for the instructor to grade your assignment. You can go to your GitHub repository using your browser to verify that your files have been submitted. Please see the TLâ€™s or the instructor if you have any questions about assignment submission.

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited
to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
